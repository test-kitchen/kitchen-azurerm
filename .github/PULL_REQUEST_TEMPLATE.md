## Type of Change

Our release process assumes you are using Conventional Commit messages.

The most important prefixes you should have in mind are:

- `_fix_`: which represents bug fixes, and correlates to a SemVer patch.
- `_feat_`: which represents a new feature, and correlates to a SemVer minor.
- `_feat!_`:, or `fix!:`, `refactor!:`, etc., which represent a breaking change (indicated by the !) and will result in a major version change.

If you have not included a conventional commit message this can be fixed on merge.
